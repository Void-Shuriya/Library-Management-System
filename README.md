# 📚 Library Management System (Java OOP Project)

This project was created as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment.  
It is a simple **console-based Library Management System** written in Java.

## 🚀 Features

-   Display available books
-   Borrow a book and set a due date
-   Return a book and calculate late fees
    -   RM1 per day if returned after due date
    -   No fee if returned before due date

## ⚠️ Notes

-   Data is stored only during program runtime (no database or file storage).
-   Closing the program clears all borrowed/returned book data.

## 📂 Project Structure

-   LibrarySystem.java # Main program
-   Book.java # Book class
-   Color.java # Console colors
